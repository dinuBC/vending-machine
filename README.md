# vending-machine
### an advanced vending machine mock-up written in Java
*The app is supposed to mimic a vending machine and has a  control-panel that permits entering an order, a stack of products that is persisted in a local MySQL database using Hibernate and a bank that takes care of money and returns the change. The machine is also capable of reports in pdf format through e-mails, presenting the sold products*

The project is under construction with the following tasks to follow:
 - Hibernate to be reconfigured in order to work with remotemysql.com
 - the bank module has to be persisted as well
 - the change releasing mechanism has to be refactored
 - better pdf formatting
